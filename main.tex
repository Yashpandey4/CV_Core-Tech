\item[]
\headerrow { \textbf{Tumour Detection in Brain Using Pre-Processing of MRI images}} {Prof. SD Joshi, July 2018 - Present}
 \begin{itemize} \item[]
Performed image enhancement and noise reduction
techniques on MRI images, then applied morphological operations to detect the tumor in the image. In the end the tumour was mapped onto
the original gray scale image with 255 intensity to make
visible the tumour in the image.
The algorithm used had two stages, first is pre-processing by converting to gray-scale image then applying high pass and median filters for image enhancement and noise reduction, and after that computing the threshhold and watershed segmentation, and finally performing morphological operations. A detailed project report can be found  \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SlMhfu_FqdmNmo-ZZoaVuqLGvVw4tHOT/view?usp=sharing}{here}.

 \headerrow { \textbf{Tracking Motion and Behavioural Patterns of Fishes}} {Prof. Aditi, August 2018 - Present}
 \begin{itemize} \item[]
 Worked with the Samsung Innovations lab in IIT Delhi to study a correlation between the random motion of fishes during different times of day and guess their behavioral patterns. Different species of fishes are being studied in tanks of different sizes and depth. The data is recorded via Kinect Studio and Processed and Analysed via MATLAB to find behavioral patterns and their correlations with the surrounding condition, in hope to obtain insight over thinking process of fishes. Phase 2 of the project to begin in October, 2018.

\headerrow { \textbf{Cell Phone Detector Circuit}} {Prof. Shouribrata Chatterjee, Jan - Mar 2018}
 \begin{itemize} \item[]
 Designed and developed a circuit which can detect Cell-Phones operational in a 10 meter radius by amplifying the specific long range signals emitted by them using high frequency chokes. Incorporated Schottky diode to rectify low frequency AC signal and ceramic capacitor to filter out AC ripples. BJT was used to amplify the signal and in conjunction with a Comparator to um-ambiguously detect a cell-phone signal.
 \end{itemize}
 
\headerrow { \textbf{Affordable Energy Generator}} {Prof. PVM Rao, July - Dec 2017}
 \begin{itemize} \item[]
 Designed and assembled a Cheap, Clean and Efficient electricity generator from scratch using a dynamo, a bicycle wheel and a step up transformer to store this energy. The design of the product was not patented and it can be manufactured for less than 100 rupees to provide cheap power to those living in rural areas in India. A presentation to the project is \href{https://csciitd-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/ee1170938_csciitd_onmicrosoft_com/EaSyGhWUxVlJg2bV1XZGJvAB0vl_h_SEt4NfQzvOdwgxYQ?e=KFC30i}{here}.

% NEN201 is a Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility Course, which requires us to volunteer in an Non-Government Organisation. Indian Road Safety Campaign \href{https://www.road-safety.co.in/}{(link)} is the largest youth led organisation in India. As a part of my intern we visited various part of Delhi and Mumbai to conduct various events and spread awareness about safety on road, all in collaboration with the Delhi Traffic Police. Being the content writer, I managed their official Social Media Handles, blogs and Newsletters to spread awareness about the same. Direct outreach exceeds \textbf{1 Million People} who are influenced by awareness campaigns every year.
